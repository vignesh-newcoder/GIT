            Origins of Cricket
Early Beginnings: Cricket originated in England during the late 16th century. It is believed to have started as a children's game in the southeast counties of England.

16th-17th Century: The first definite reference to cricket being played dates back to 1597. By the early 17th century, it was played by adults and became popular among the rural population.

Development of the Game
18th Century: Cricket evolved into a more organized sport with formal rules. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in 1787 and became the custodian of the laws of cricket.
